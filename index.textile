title: Penub PHP Framework
---

h1. What is Penub?

Penub (PHP Nuts and Bolts) is a lean, robust PHP microkernel intended for building slik web applications with least distraction.

h2. What is it not?

Penub is not a CMS. Nor will it ever be, if you want a PHP CMS, download Drupal
Penub is not a “full-stack framework” with ORM for SQL databases. We actually enjoy writing code against document databases and never believed in ORMs to begin with.
Penub is not a port of RubyOnRails, Django, Struts, Tapestry, [insert some other here] framework to PHP

h2. Credits

Modular architecture of Penub is greatly inspired by architectural modularity of Drupal. A lot of cool ideas were shamelessly borrowed from Rails, as well.
